# Triage Prediction Models Spring 2024
BE 5740 Group #2 Project

## Background
The emergency department (ED) triage process is crucial for ensuring timely patient care. However, evaluating patients' conditions and vital signs to prioritize those in greatest need can be complex and overwhelming, especially in crowded EDs. To address this, machine learning models can predict triage outcomes based on patient data, optimizing EDs for better resource allocation and timely identification of patients requiring emergency attention.

## Project Overview
This project presents four optimized classification models to enhance ED triage: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN). We explored two scenarios: (1) with access to patient vital signs (trained on all features) and (2) without vital signs (trained on a subset of features).

After evaluating the performance of each model, we selected the best-performing model for our Smart Triage software. This model was chosen based on its accuracy, efficiency, and ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

Benefits of Smart Triage Software
Our Smart Triage software approach facilitates accurate patient care prioritization and enhances mistriage prediction. Key benefits include:
- Early detection and prioritization of critical conditions, enabling rapid intervention and potentially life-saving measures.
- A decision aid for healthcare providers to accurately prioritize cases.

We demonstrated the feasibility of our Smart Triage software to "Skip the Queue, Save the Day" and bridge the gap between nurse burnout and mistriage. Our algorithm shows the potential of AI-driven triage systems to revolutionize emergency care and possibly integrate into EHR data for more efficient triage.
